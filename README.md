This repository contains a website created for a group project.

The assignment was to create a modern, user friendly and informative website for a fictious golf club. It should attract both new and old members, as well as increase the clubs visibility and engagement online. The finished product should be fully responsive, accessible and have a clear visual identity, as well as basic SEO implementation. 

We conducted this project over 5 consecutive weeks, and it was split into 4 SCRUM Sprints.

Target audience:
* Members
* Visitors
* Companies

// Important to note that this course was HTML and CSS, so some functionality like the booking calendar, login etc. are currently just placeholders. But we will likely get to update and improve the website and functionality in coming courses.

The website had to include the following:

1. A startpage with a welcome message and introduction, news updates and quick links to important sections.
2. An "about us" page about the clubs history and vision, information about the course and the clubs facilities, and memberships and perks.
3. A booking page with information about greenfee and booking rules.
4. A page about contests and events, with an event calendar and a sign up-form.
5. A membership page with log in and registration for members, a forum and newsletter, as well as exclusive membership perks.
6. A contact page with contact information, opening hours, map, and forms for feedback and questions.
7. A restaurant and shop-page containing a menu, information about the clubs restaurant and information about the shops products.
