# Golfklubben

<i>This course was <b>ONLY</b> about learning <ins>HTML and CSS</ins>. Therefore some functionality like the booking calendar, login etc. Are currently just placeholders and/or mockups. But we will likely get to update and improve the website and functionality in coming courses.</i>

## The assignment

The assignment was to create a modern, user friendly and informative website for a fictitious golf club. It should attract both new and old members, as well as increase the clubs visibility and engagement online. The finished product should be fully responsive, accessible and have a clear visual identity, as well as basic SEO implementation. 

### Target audience:
<ul>
  <li>Members</li>
  <li>Visitors</li>
  <li>Companies</li>
</ul>

### The website had to include the following:

1. A startpage with a welcome message and introduction, news updates and quick links to important sections.
2. An "about us" page about the clubs history and vision, information about the course and the clubs facilities, and memberships and perks.
3. A booking page with information about greenfee and booking rules.
4. A page about contests and events, with an event calendar and a sign up-form.
5. A membership page with log in and registration for members, a forum and newsletter, as well as exclusive membership perks.

This project was conducted over 5 consecutive weeks, split into 4 SCRUM Sprints. While working on this group assignment, we were all simultaneously working on individual assignments as well. We learned a lot about Agile Principles, group dynamics, web development and even a little about golf ;).

In this repository you will find our final product, created according to above specified assignment.
